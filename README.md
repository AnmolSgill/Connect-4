# running the game
Our implementation offers two modes for running the game. The game can be played by running the main.py file or by running the gui.py file. The main.py version runs through the command line and displays pruned and visited node count (where applicable). The gui.py version displays a connect 4 game using Pygame and displays pruned count (where applicable) on game termination. Both versions incorporate all modes (AI vs Human, Human vs Gemini, Gemini vs Agent, Agent vs Agent)
